Having cleared the EX180 exam yesterday I thought it would be useful for anyone else preparing to collate my key findings and tips for doing the exam. I've tried to keep the below generic enough as to not ruin the exam. Best of luck!

## Exam setup and structure

The exam is 2 hours long and you'll have to complete a number of containber-related tasks in a virtual environment. 

**If you're doing the exam at home:**
The virtual environment is a custom ISO Red Hat provide when booking the exam, you'll need a USB with a minimum of 8gb and use a [tool](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the USB (I've linked the one I and other colleagues used). You'll want to use a windows laptop to boot this as I (and others) had issues trying to boot from a USB on my Macbook (perhaps due to work security constraints). You'll also be required to have an external webcam as well as the inbuilt laptop webcam, both will need to be clear enough that the proctor can read your ID (e.g passport, driving license etc.) from it. You can't use a wireless keyboard and mouse either, they have to be wired if you plan to use one.

**If you're doing the exam at an exam centre:**
I would recommend doing the exam from a centre, you'll definitely have a smoother experience and have less things to worry about. The virtual environment at home is quite laggy and more likely to cause you more stress than you need. Doing the exam at a centre would guarantee you can focus more on the tasks at hand rather than the environment bugging out.
